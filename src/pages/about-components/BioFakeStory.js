      As a child, I was always curious and passionate about the little things in
      life. I wasn't very good at academics. I came from the slums of Mumbai,
      but I dreamed of being a global citizen. My life took an unexpected turn
      when I got seperated from my parents at a young age. This led me to become
      a part of a stable of thieves in Mumbai. The life of a petty criminal
      wasn't agreeable to me so I made way by doing small jobs here and there.
      As an 18-year-old, I found myself answering questions on the Indian
      version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", which was the turning point in
      my life. It also united me with the love of my life! Wait! This sounds
      like a story loosely based around slumdog millionaire. This isn't my real story!
