        Hi! My Name is Raghav and I am from India. I live in a city called
        Chandigarh, but I love to travel whenever I get the opportunity. I work
        as a Full Stack Web Developer, although I am formally educated in law
        with a few years of experience as a litigator. 

        I love coding and developing solutions with software.
